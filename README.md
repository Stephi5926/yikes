Well lets turn this into fun.

<h1> Hello and yikes </h2>

this is a project in several let us say twigs
of the same branch and the master in the end
The first problem is that there seems to be nothing on
heaven or earth that will allow me to to the 
experiments.  So this is truly yikes at the moment as
only one text shadow experiment worked and it took endless
tries to do so.  The first thing then and it no doubt 
is me dreaming behind my ability.  The first issue
then how do you produce graphic elements where they can be 
seen.  I was excited yesterday at the idea, and today
I can not do the simplist test.  So is this software alone
and no images? Am I in the wrong forum to do color experiments 
to become software?  If it is this difficult then I say it is a 
needful thing?  So do I need to have my own site to see the
results as we are talking color.  Then bring the code here?
Then how does the team understand what the code is for.
This may be the last go at these repositories and think of
something else that interests me.I need a goal in mind.
Clearly I have a re-evaluation to do. It was grueling and 
discouraging to fail over and over, and this was a life
long dream.  So Yikes it is.If anyone else is able to say if 
this is possible then please let me know. I mean games have
plenty of color and there are graphics projects.
